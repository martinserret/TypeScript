<html><head></head><body><p>This section was recorded a few years ago. In the meantime, the frontend web development ecosystem has started to move away from Webpack (though it's still used by a decent amount of projects)&nbsp;towards more modern tools like Vite.</p><p>In addition, even when using a Webpack-based project, you typically don't need to set up and configure Webpack yourself. Just as with Vite, you'll instead often work with a project that was created for you.</p><p>Nonetheless, I decided to keep this section online since it might be useful for developers who DO&nbsp;need to work with Webpack themselves or who do want to understand how tools like Webpack interact with&nbsp;TypeScript.</p><p>Feel free to skip (or watch with 2x speed)&nbsp;this section if you're not interested in that.</p></body></html>
