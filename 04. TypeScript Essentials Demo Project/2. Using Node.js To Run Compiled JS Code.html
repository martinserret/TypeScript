<html><head></head><body><p>In this and many other sections, I'll occasionally run compiled code with Node.js - simply to save us the hassle of building a (demo) website that loads and executes that code.</p><p>You can install the Node.js runtime from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://nodejs.org/en</a> (it's available for all operating systems).</p><p>This runtime allows you to run JavaScript code right on your system (via the <code>node</code> command) instead of requiring a website.</p><p>So when you see me run <code>node app.js</code> (or some other file), that's me using Node.js to execute the code.</p></body></html>
